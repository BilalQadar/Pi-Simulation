# Pi-Simulation

This program simulates the value of pi (3.14159). It uses fact that the 4 divided by the ratio of a circle and squares area is pi. 

The program randomly throws "darts" at a square dart board. In said dartboard is a circle who's origin is the center of the square and whos diameter is the same as the squares side length. After throwing n darts at the board, the number of darts which landed in the circle and those that landed in the square are compared using the above expression to determine pi.
